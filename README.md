## Control-of-car-using-hand-gestures

#Introduction

This project we have designed a simple Hand Gesture Controlled Robot using RasperryPi to classify 4 hand gestures (pointer,stop,punch,peace) using ensemble of deep learning architectures for control of car robot.This Hand Gesture Controlled Robot is based on RasperryPi, WebCam and L293D Motor Driver.

The preprocessing and collection of data is based on the following tutorial [ Computer Vision and Machine Learning with Python, Keras and OpenCV](https://github.com/jrobchin/Computer-Vision-Basics-with-Python-Keras-and-OpenCV/).
