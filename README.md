## Project Demo
This project we have designed a simple Hand Gesture Controlled Robot using RasperryPi to classify 4 hand gestures (pointer,stop,punch,peace) using ensemble of deep learning architectures for control of car robot.This Hand Gesture Controlled Robot is based on RasperryPi, WebCam and L293D Motor Driver.
